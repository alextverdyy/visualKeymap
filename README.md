# visualKeymap
On-screen visual keymap. Tool to learn new keyboard layouts


This code can be used to generate a small App compatible with macOS or Windows, in which your custom visual keymap is displayed always-on-top to be used as a reminder while learning.

To be able to compile, first unzip all "node_modules.zip" content

You will be able to generate a macOS executable file runing: "npm run make" 
If you want to generate the Windows .exe, you can configure it in the package.json file.
If you need further guidance, research about how to export an Electron app.

The visual keymap can be replaced by your own one, just replace the .PNG file

Enjoy!
